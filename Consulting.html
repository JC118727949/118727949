        <!-- About Blockchain -->
        <p>
          The Blockchain was first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared database that updates itself in real-time. 
          It can process and settle transactions in a number of  minutes using computer algorithms,
          with no need for third-party verification.
          Because it does not require manual processing, nor authentication through intermediaries, 
          banks - both commercial ones and central banks  reckon the technology has the potential to make payments faster, more reliable and easier to audit.

        <!-- paragraph on Autonomous Things -->
        <p>
           Autonomous Things(Robots) is the first tech trend on Gartner’s list. In recent years, we have seen robots, drones, cars,
           appliances and other types of autonomous things(robots) perform tasks that would normally be performed by humans.
           It is said that we can expect big advances in this technology in the near future.
          “As autonomous things proliferate, we expect a shift from stand-alone intelligent things to a swarm of collaborative intelligent things,
           with multiple devices working together, either independently of people or with human input,” said Mr. Cearley. “For example, if a drone examined a large field and found that it was ready for harvesting, it could dispatch an ‘autonomous harvester.’
           Or in the delivery market, the most effective solution may be to use an autonomous vehicle to move packages to the target area.
           Robots and drones on board the vehicle could then ensure final delivery of the package.”
        </p>
        
        <ul><p>This is how some Autonomous Things(Robots) are currently being used:
                <li> Intel’s use of a drone swarm for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in 2018.</li>
                <li> A plan for Dubai to use autonomous police vehicles that can deploy their own drones for surveillance.</li>
                <li> Cooperative merge scenarios by Honda and other car manufacturers, in which vehicles communicate with one another to optimise traffic flows.</li>  
        </p>
        </ul>

        <!-- paragraph on Immersive Experience -->
        <p>
          Immersive technology is a mix of virtual content and the physical environment in a way which allows the user to engage and communicate with the mixed reality.
          In an immersive experience, users accept virtual elements of their environment as part of the whole,
          potentially becoming less conscious that those elements are not part of physical reality.
        <ul>There are many different types of Immersive Technologies,which include:
            <li>Virtual reality (VR)</li>
            <li>Augmented reality (AR)</li>
            <li>Mixed reality (MR)</li>
        </ul>
