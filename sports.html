        <center><h1>Powerlifting</h1></center>
        
        <p>I started powerlifting when I was in sixth year.When I first started it was 
        because I wanted to become stronger and it was only a hobby as such.</p>
        <p>As time went on I grew more fond of the sport and did my first competition,placing third.</p>
        <p>I also did a competition last December and won my overall category,Hitting 
        Personal Records too which I was delighted with.
        <p>I train 5-6 times a week usually in my gym at home but I also train in the Maradyke Arena 
        since I have many breaks during my college day.</p>
